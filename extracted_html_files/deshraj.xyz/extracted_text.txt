       üëã I'm Deshraj Yadav, Co-founder and CTO at
       
        Mem0
       
       (f.k.a Embedchain). I am broadly interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Infrastructure.
      

       üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Previously, I was Senior Autopilot Engineer at Tesla Autopilot where I led the Autopilot's AI Platform which helped the Tesla Autopilot team to track large scale training and model evaluation experiments, provide monitoring and observability into jobs and training cluster issues.
      

       üöÄ I had built
       
        EvalAI
       
       as my
       
        masters thesis
       
       at Georgia Tech (advised by
       
        Dhruv Batra
       
       and
       
        Devi Parikh
       
       ), which is
      an open-source platform for evaluating and comparing machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms ü§ñ at
      scale.
      

       üèè Outside of work, I am very much into cricket and play in two leagues (
       
        Cricbay
       
       and
       
        NACL

       (September 2023 - Present)
      

       (Jul 2019 - September 2023)
      

       Lead Autopilot's AI Platform that enables the team to:
      



       Previously, I worked in AI-Tooling team where I was responsible for designing and implementing a diverse set of tools like 3D-labelling platform, model versioning tool, and active learning based label boosting software.
      

       (Mar 2019 - Mar 2020)
      

       Caliper is the only platform that enables recruiters to evaluate practical AI skills. At scale.
      Through automated challenges on real-world problems.
      

       (May 2018 - Aug 2018)
      

       Building scalable end-to-end platform to train, test, and visualize machine learning algorithms
      on massive amounts of visual data.
      

       (Jun 2016 - May 2017)
      

       Worked on the problem of
       
        Visual Dialog
       
       which later got
      accepted in CVPR 2017 as a Spotlight Paper. During my visit, I also worked as Teaching Assistant for
       
        Intro. to Machine Learning Course
       
       for
      Fall-2016 instructed by
       
        Dr. Stefan Lee
       
       .
      

       (Mar 2016 - Present)
      

       Served as Organization Mentor for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2016. Later, I have been serving
      as an Organization Administrator in GSoC 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020.
      

       (Apr 2015 - Aug 2015)
      

       Selected for GSOC 2015 under CloudCV Organization. My responsibilities included integrating
      NVIDIA's Deep Learning Framework DIGITS to provide workspaces for the researchers and other computer vision
      developers.
      

       (Dec 2015 - Feb 2016)
      

       Responsible for setting an automated test suite for Continuous Integration in the backend
      codebase which led to a very lean software engineering team as the team was able to spend more time on building
      new features rather than maintaining and fixing bugs and issues.
      

       (Sep 2015 - Dec 2015)
      

       Worked on building an IoT based product for indoor navigation in big offices and malls using
      Beacons (Low Energy Bluetooth devices). I was responsible for building REST APIs and creating the Android
      Application from scratch which communicates with the beacons to get real time position of a person using beacons
      signal strength.
      

       (Aug 2014 - Dec 2014)
      

       Responsible for the development of the whole product from scratch, managing the server,
      database management and other backend scripting.
      

       (May 2014 - Jul 2014)
      

       Responsible for development of
       
        company's web application
       
       ,
      Facebook App development and setting up NoSQL database. Implemented scripts to do image enhancement, and
      cropping borders etc.
      

       Specialization in Machine Learning
      

       Expected Graduation: December 2018
      

       GPA: 3.7/4.0
      

       Passed with an aggregate of 78% (with Hons.)
      

       Class Rank: 9th rank (or top-6%)
      

       Open source platform to create, collaborate and participate in the AI Challenges organized around the globe.
      

       Proof of concept of a central, standardized open source platform for human-in-the-loop evaluation of AI
        agents.
        Developed the infrastructure to pair Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) users in real-time with artificial visual
        dialog agents.
      

       Fabrik is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models via a simple
        drag-and-drop interface.
      

       Built a visual chatbot which can hold a meaningful dialog with humans natural, conversational language about
        visual content. Specifically, given an image, a dialog history, and a question about the image, the chatbot
        has to ground the question in image, infer context from history, and answer the question accurately.
      

       In Visual Question Answering, given an image and a free-form natural language question about the image (e.g.,
        "What kindof store is this?", "How many people are waiting in the queue?", "Is it safe to cross the street?")
        the model's task is to automatically produce a concise, accurate, free-form, natural language answer
        ("bakery", "5", "Yes"). This demo is implemented using
       
        Hierarchical Question-Image Co-Attention
       
       model.
      

       Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a novel class-discriminative localization technique,
        that can be used to make CNN based models interpretable. Grad-CAM highlights regions of the image the VQA
        model looks at while making predictions. Given an image and a caption or question about that image, the model
        shows where it looked while doing prediction.
      

       Origami is an AI-as-a-service that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an
        online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the
        dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model.
      

       Beam search, the standard work-horse for decoding outputs from neural sequence models like RNNs produces
        generic and uninteresting sequences. This is inadequate for AI tasks with inherent ambiguity ‚Äî for example,
        there can be multiple correct ways of describing the contents of an image. The demo overcomes this by
        proposing a diversity-promoting replacement,
       
        Diverse Beam Search
       
       that produces sequences that are
        significantly different ‚Äî with runtime and memory requirements comparable to beam search.
      

       Web based application that acts as a medium for interaction between all students, faculties and management of
        JSSATE Noida college. Officially recognized by college. Serves 10,000+ requests per day, 20,000+ users,
