Hey there, this is Pranay!
I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, focusing on Deep Learning and Computer
Vision. My academic path has led me to explore the compelling crossroads of these fields, giving me the opportunity to delve deep and
gain hands-on experience.
Previously, I was a Graduate Student Researcher with Reality Labs team at Meta, collaborating with Dr. Shane Moon on the IMU2CLIP
project. I also had the opportunity to be a research intern at AirLab, associated with the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.
There, I worked alongside Dr. Chen Wang and Dr. Sebastian Scherer on Few Shot Object Detection, and contributed towards PyPose.
My initial steps into research were guided by Dr. Sumeet Kumar at the Indian School of Business Hyderabad, where I worked on
identifying surrogate product placements in YouTube Kids videos using Few Shot Learning.
